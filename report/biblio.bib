        abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python
                  that combines the convenience of NumPy’s syntax with the
                  speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes
                  mathematical expressions in a high-level description that
                  mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically
                  typed and functional (as opposed to imperative). These
                  expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic
                  differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano
                  optimizes the choice of expressions, translates them into C++
                  (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded
                  Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning
                  algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5×
                  faster than competitive alternatives (including those
                  implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled
                  for the CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for
                  the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines
                  the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU
                  and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}
