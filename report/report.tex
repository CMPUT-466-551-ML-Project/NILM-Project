\abstract{
Whatever we exactly did. Something about how, for Internet of Things, device on/off is more readily available
Would be very useful if could train off it combined with the aggregated data, rather than also using the disaggregated data or taking an unsupervised approach.
}

NOTE: Needs to be cleaned up now
NOTE: sub-metering is the word we want for measuring disaggregated energy signals
%TODO: Do we assume that are either ON or OFF, or that they can have multiple levels?
	%NOTE: another paper assumed that 'all appliances that have more than two states (e.g., on and off) will produce events that can be explained by two-state appliances'
%TODO: Outline where we got the data from

\section{Introduction}

Energy disaggregation (or NILM, non-intrusive load-monitoring) is the problem of estimating individual appliance energy consumption from a single measure of an entire household's energy consumption.
Studies have shown people are motivated to save energy when given knowledge of appliance energy consumption \cite{Darby}.
Faulty devices could also be identified by abnormal energy consumption.


%TODO: Find paper that references difficulty of adapting to new house
**May not be correct** Due to the diversity of devices, both which are used in a house and their power consumption, it can be difficult to generalize from one house to another.

%TODO: List of a few papers that require this. Include all that we are referencing at other spots and that do this
Many existing methodologies for NILM require the aggregated energy usage for a house and the energy usage for each device of interest during the same time period \cite{Kelly, Cicchetti}. 
%TODO: Find paper that references this. Also, sentence should be better
However, recording the energy usage for each device is difficult, due to the requirement of adding sensors to each device.
With the increase in the Internet of Things, we expect that more devices will be able to indicate when they are using power to the server.
It is, however, unlikely that the necessary **tooling** to record the actual power used will not be installed into these devices.
Thus, the existing methodologies would not be able to benefit from these changes in devices.


%TODO: This needs to clearly outline that we are NOT learning on the specific house, to handle future data, but are instead preprocessing for the training data
In this report, we investigate different methods for taking the aggregated energy usage and information for when devices are on and generate information about how much power each device was using.


%TODO: What did we accomplish

\section{Related Work}

%NOTE: Should focus on research relevant to ours. Don't know how much there is.
%TODO: Should also outline one or two unsupervised approaches.
There have not been any studies of NIML using information about what time points each device was on at.
%TODO: Cite all of these
There have been supervised approaches using the disaggregated energy\cite{} or energy signatures \cite{} for each device.
Some unsupervised approaches, also exist that only use the aggregated energy of the overall house.
%TODO: Mention something about related approaches or similar ideas?

\subsection{Independent Component Analysis}

%TODO: Soundwaves is the wrong word
To use ICA, we would need to assume that the signature for each device is statistically independent, which is unfortunately not true.
%TODO: Find citation for this
As well, ICA performs best when there are multiple different 'sound waves', but with NILM there would only be the power being used by the house for each timestep.
Thus, we believe that applying independent component analysis will not achieve significantly better results to existing methods.

%TODO: Should these be the approach name, or something else?
\subsection{Supervised Approaches}

%TODO: Citations for this
These approaches often use Hidden Markov Models, or a variant like dHMM, or using a neural network to estimate the power consumption for each device.

One approach that uses some form of HMMs is Parsons Method for NILM \cite{Cicchetti}.
This method uses one difference Hidden Markov Model (dHMM) per device to describe its consumption and figure out at what time it was active.
%TODO: Make sure is correct, and possibly cite this
A dHMM is very similar to an HMM, but it has an additional hidden variables for the difference from the previous to current state.
While this approach does not require the disaggreated energy signature per device, it does require prior knowledge in the form of 

There have also been many teams that use neural networks to disaggregate the power consumption. 
Kelly and Knottenbelt identify that often signal reconstruction is not integral to applications.
Therefore, they take their task to be identification of a begin time, end time, and overall energy usage of a specific device, during the first cycle it is used.
They attempt to solve the problem via an amalgamation of Constitutional, Feed forward, and recurrent neural nets, combined with a denoising error\footnote{Viewing other data as `noise' may also cut out the holistic approach to the problem, removing the problem of global consistency.} and training on each device individually\footnote{This may ignore inherent relationships between different devices (though perhaps the neural networks account for this).
Perhaps a way to `double check' nets are correct may provide a more effective, holistic approach.}.
Due to the extensive data set one needs to train deep nets, the pair generates synthetic data by combining data with `noise' data\footnote{The data they generate is naive, and we will likely see performance increases from a more realistic generation of data, or through pre-training on large amounts of unlabelled data, then a less extensive training on real data.}.
I did not understand how data was selected for training, but I do no it is normalized to have mean zero -- which may or may not reduce the ability to consistently identify features.

Questions about the paper:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using Convolutional Neural networks (Time Invariant).
	\item Ignoring all but first activation.
	\item Why does the algorithm ignore all but the first activation.
	\item Local to Global.
	\item NILMTK will be useful!
	\item Periodicity.
\end{enumerate}
​
One neural network is trained per target appliance, based on real data and synthetically generated data.

**Another interesting aspect of the paper was how they used Denoising Autoencoders.
​
\subsubsection{Deep Recurrent Neural Networks}
​
A standard recurrent neural network with $t$ layers assumes a statistical model is parameterized by matrices $A,B$ and $C$ and a bias vector $b$, where if $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is observed, then our output $y$ is generated iteratively by the equations
%
\[ h_t = \sigma(A h_{t-1} + B x + b) \]
%
\[ y = C h_N \]
%
We feed our data through the neural network $N$ times before generating the output.
It may be of interest to use Long short-term memory architectures, defining $h_t$ instead by
%
\[ I_t = \sigma(Ax + B h_{t-1} + C c_{t-1} + b_1) \]
%
\[ F_t = \sigma(Dx + E h_{t-1} + F c_{t-1} + b_2) \]
%
\[ c_t = F_t c_{t-1} + I_t \tanh(G x + H h_{t-1} + b_3) \]
%
\[ o_t = \sigma(K x + L h + M c_t + b_4) \]
%
\[ h_t = o_t \tanh(c_t) \]
​
Bidirectional networks use forward and backward sequences, which compute ...
​
What's nice about these types of neural networks is that we can analyze them as a dynamical system -- which matches up nicely as viewing pre-training as a dynamical system!

\section{Our Stuff}

%TODO: This one could be useful
Known as nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) various researchers have investigated this problem.
Weiss (Source3?) presume the power consumption as a sequence of piecewise constant consumption levels whose differences describe the typical consumption pattern of a distinct device.
Since they get remarkable F-scores of 80\% and higher for some devices we also had a look for signal where this assumption holds.

Unlike many of the other methods, we are assuming that we do not have the disaggregated power signature for each device during the learning stage.
Instead, we assume to instead have accurate information about when each device is active, due to the trend of the "Internet of Things".
Where many devices are connected to the internet, and could thus provide information about when they are active.
%TODO: Get paper for this?

\subsection{Task}



\subsection{Evaluation}

%TODO: Whatever evaluation function to see how well the neural network does after training.
%May even want to use two or more, to see if they work better in different circumstances

Then, we will compare the results for the different trained denoising autoencoder neural nets, based on the data that we preprocessed.

Will train and evaluate on the devices %TODO: write out devices
